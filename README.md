# PHP-Useful-Array-Functions
I will create a series of array functions which are all intended to be useful for developers; these functions will be created as I encounter, in my own development work, functionality I wish existed in PHP but does not currently exist.

The first function created for this purpose is a function which sorts (either descending or ascending) an array of hexadecimal values
